# arubacloud_blockstorage

Manages an ArubaCloud Block Storage.

## Example Usage

### Zonal Block Storage

Zonal block storage is tied to a specific zone within a location. This is useful when you need the storage to be in a specific zone (e.g., for attaching to a cloud server in that zone).

```terraform
resource "arubacloud_blockstorage" "zonal_example" {
  name          = "zonal-blockstorage"
  project_id    = "your-project-id"
  location      = "ITBG-Bergamo"  # Change to your region
  size_gb       = 100
  billing_period = "Hour"
  zone          = "ITBG-1"  # Zonal storage - tied to this specific zone
  type          = "Standard"
  tags          = ["storage", "zonal", "test"]
}
```

### Regional Block Storage

Regional block storage is available across all zones in the location. This is useful when you want the storage to be accessible from any zone in the region.

```terraform
resource "arubacloud_blockstorage" "regional_example" {
  name          = "regional-blockstorage"
  project_id    = "your-project-id"
  location      = "ITBG-Bergamo"  # Change to your region
  size_gb       = 100
  billing_period = "Hour"
  # zone is not specified - creates regional storage
  type          = "Standard"
  tags          = ["storage", "regional", "test"]
}
```

## Schema

### Arguments

The following arguments are supported:

#### Required

- `billing_period` (String) Billing period (Hour, Month, Year)
- `location` (String) Block Storage location/region
- `name` (String) Block Storage name
- `project_id` (String) ID of the project this Block Storage belongs to
- `size_gb` (Number) Size of the block storage in GB
- `type` (String) Type of block storage (Standard, Performance)

#### Optional

- `zone` (String) Zone where blockstorage will be created. If not specified, the block storage will be regional (available across all zones in the location). If specified, the block storage will be zonal (tied to a specific zone).
- `tags` (List of String) List of tags for the block storage

### Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

#### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Block Storage identifier
- `uri` (String) Block Storage URI

## Regional vs Zonal Block Storage

- **Regional Block Storage**: Created when `zone` is not specified. The storage is available across all zones in the specified location. This provides flexibility but may have different performance characteristics.

- **Zonal Block Storage**: Created when `zone` is specified. The storage is tied to a specific zone within the location. This is required when attaching the storage to a cloud server that is also in a specific zone.

## Import

Aruba Cloud BlockStorage can be imported using the `blockstorage_id`.

```shell
terraform import arubacloud_blockstorage.example <blockstorage_id>
```
